**QR Code Generator Using Python**

**Overview**

This project provides a versatile tool for generating QR codes using Python. The script can create QR codes from various types of data, such as URLs, text, or structured data like JSON. The generated QR code is saved as an image file, making it easy to share and use in different applications.

**Features**

Flexible Data Input: Generate QR codes from any type of data, including URLs, plain text, and structured data.

Image Generation: Saves the generated QR code as a PNG image file.

Customizable Output: The image file is named based on the content, allowing for easy identification.

Simple and Lightweight: Easy to integrate into other projects or use as a standalone script.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.x installed on your system.
Required Python packages: qrcode, PIL (included with the qrcode package).
**Installation**
Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone url
cd qr-code-generator
Install Required Python Packages:

Usage
Generate a QR Code:


Modify the script to include your data in the json_data variable or pass the data directly to the get_qrcode function.
python
Copy code
json_data = {
    'name': 'Example',
    'age': 27
}
image_qrcode = get_qrcode(json_data)
